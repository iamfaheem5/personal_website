# Welcome to Our Blog!

This is a sample post to demonstrate how the MDX blogging system works. You can write in Markdown or use JSX components.

## What is MDX?

MDX allows you to write in Markdown while mixing in React components.

For example, here's an inline code: `console.log('Hello World!')`

And a block:

```jsx
const Greeting = () => <h1>Hello, MDX!</h1>;

// Use it like this:
<Greeting />
```

Feel free to add more posts by creating new .mdx files in the `posts` directory with frontmatter.
